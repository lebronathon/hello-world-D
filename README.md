place to talk about ideas

My name is Noah Flood. I'm currently a junior in highschool and begninning my journey in the programming world. As of now I am becoming familiar with the C langauge and will be taking AP Computer Science A next year. The first project on my agenda is to recreate (or I guess technically 'port') one of my scratch programs into C or some other language.
